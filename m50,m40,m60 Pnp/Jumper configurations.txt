Using hall type sensors instead of stock vr:

JP23 and JP24 are used to power optional hall sensors with 5v or 12v. Do not use these with VR conditioner!
In rev 1.x the power will be sent to pin2 in the sensor connector. Pin 1 will be signal and pin 3 is ground.
In rev 2.x the power will be sent to pin1 in the sensor connector. Pin 2 will be signal and pin 3 is ground.
If sensors require pull-up resistor, the R39 is used for that for crank and R40 is for cam.
In addition to that R59 and R60 need to be added to get the signal to processor when VR-conditioner is not used and
you need to jumper 2-3 in JP31.

ALSO NOTE that do not install the vr-conditioner when hall sensor(s) are used.
